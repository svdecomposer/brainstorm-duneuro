This folder should store different mesh models

test_sphere_tet.msh : mesh file generated by tetgen. 
This file is the input of the duneuro code. 
It contains the liste of the nodes (vetices) and the list of the elements. 

duneuro_model.mat : matalab data file It contains the similar mesh as test_sphere_tet.msh
but with more other informations. 

>> load('duneuro_model.mat')
surface: [1×1 struct] : Structure that contains the surface information
>> model.surface
   struct with fields:
    scalp: [1×1 struct]
    outer: [1×1 struct]
    inner: [1×1 struct]
     head: [1×1 struct]
>> model.surface.head
   struct with fields:
    node: [1000×3 double]
    face: [1996×3 double]
List of the nodes and face of the head. 
Similar data are stored for each tissus.


tissus_id: [1 2 3]  : The identification/label of the three domains.
tissus: {'inner'  'outer'  'scalp'} : The name of the three domains.

source: [10×3 double] : the liste of the source space / dipoles with the 3D position



radii: [80 86 92] : radii of the three sphere from the inner to the outer 
center: [127 127 127] : center of the three sphere 
conductivity: [1 0.0125 1] : value of the conductivities (relatives value) 

save_result: 0  : Optin used to save the results at each computation of the lf.(matlab code will be shared later)

          tissus: {'inner'  'outer'  'scalp'} : guess what


elec: [200×3 double] : electrode position x,y,z
elec_on_node: [200×3 double] : same as elec but the electrode position are interpolated to th nearest mesh node on the surface
