This folder contains the matlab functions and scripts 
The main script is : bst_fem_lf_process.m

From this you can follow the 5 main steps from mesh generation from surfaces to the lf computation. 

ICBM152_8233.mat : is the output of the computation 
bst_lf_vector_mosher.m : this function is based on John script that we use to plot the leadfiled matrix as a vector in each source postion. 

At new part is added and it compute the BEM solution using the OpenMeeg 
the functions bst_lf_vector_mosher and test_bem work fine but created quickly without documentation. 

The fem and bem solution for this example are already computed : 
quick use is : 
%% Compare the two solution
load('ICBM152_8233.mat')
v_bem = sum(zscore(vol.lf_bem),2) ;
v_fem = sum(zscore(vol.lf_fem),2) ;
figure;
plot(v_bem,'ro'); hold on
plot(v_fem,'k*'); hold on
clear grid;
grid on; grid minor
legend('bem openmeeg','fem duneuro');

%% John Verification
bst_lf_vector_mosher(vol)
