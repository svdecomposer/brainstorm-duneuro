This file summurize the problems we face, the solution and the next steps : 

Compile correctely the duneuro again !!
 
Write a documentation about the Duneuro/bst

Which is the reference electrode

How to define the anisotropy for DN
  
How to define the level set with DN and hat are the main parameters

difference of the implemnation of the transfer matrix

What is the superALU ? how it works and is it available for windows

Compile DN again

Write the ladfiled matrix from DN as binary instead of the text file

Get a fixed and stable version

Generate the exe for linux and test on mac and linux envirenement

Write the bst tutorial and apply the FEM method similar to the openmeeg tuto : https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Duneuro#preview

Move to tetgen instead of iso2mesh for mesh generation


difference of the implemnation of the transfer matrix
how to define he anisotropie
how do you define the level set approcah
how is the connectivity defined in the level set 
how do you define the conductivity anisotropy in the case of the level set?   
do you have any model available
it take to much time with the exe ... ~ 2 hours for the 8233 nodes and 32 electrodes 3 layer model
